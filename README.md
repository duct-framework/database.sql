# Duct database.sql [![Build Status](https://github.com/duct-framework/database.sql/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duct-framework/database.sql/actions/workflows/test.yml)


[Integrant][] methods for connecting to a SQL database from the
[Duct][] framework.

For pooled connections, use [database.sql.hikaricp][].

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your deps.edn file:

    org.duct-framework/database.sql {:mvn/version "0.2.0"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [org.duct-framework/database.sql "0.2.0"]

## Usage

This library provides two things: a `Boundary` record that holds a
database spec, and a multimethod for `:duct.database/sql` that
initiates a database spec into the `Boundary`.

```edn
{:duct.database/sql {:connection-uri "jdbc:sqlite:db/example.sqlite"}}
```

When you write functions against the database, consider using a
protocol and extending the `Boundary` record. This will allow you to
easily mock or stub out the database using a tool like [Shrubbery][].
