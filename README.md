## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:

    [duct/database.sql "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Usage

This library provides two things: a `Boundary` record that holds a
database spec, and a multimethod for `:duct.database/sql` that
initiates a database spec into the `Boundary`.

When you write functions against the database, consider using a
protocol and extending the `Boundary` record. This will allow you to
easily mock or stub out the database using a tool like [Shrubbery][].
